## Introduction
This Chrome extension ("Extension") is developed to enhance your experience while using `salesforce.com`. The Extension requires certain permissions to function correctly, and this Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and protected. By using this Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

## Data Collection and Use

### Browser Data
The Extension only collects and interacts with data from your browser when you are logged into the `salesforce.com` website. This includes:

- **Read/Write Access**: The Extension may read data from and write data to the Salesforce website, but only to perform tasks directly related to its functionality.
  
No personal data, such as browsing history, login information, or other personal identifiers, will be collected or stored by this Extension outside the `salesforce.com` domain.

### Salesforce-Specific Data
The Extension solely interacts with Salesforce-specific data. This includes:

- Accessing data visible or modifiable on Salesforce if you are authenticated and logged in.
- Making modifications or updates to Salesforce data as per the extension's functionality.

This data is only used locally within your browser session and is not shared with any third parties or external servers. No information will be collected from other websites, even if opened in other browser tabs or windows.

## Permissions Required

To function properly, this Extension requires the following permissions:

- **Read Access to salesforce.com**: This allows the Extension to read the Salesforce data in your browser when you're logged in.
  
These permissions are strictly limited to Salesforce-related activities and are necessary to provide the intended functionality of the Extension.

## Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or distribute any of the data accessed or processed by this Extension with third parties. Your data remains within the browser and is used solely for providing functionality related to Salesforce.

## Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect your data and ensure that it remains secure. The Extension does not store any data permanently and operates entirely within your browser. No data is transmitted to external servers or stored outside of your active session.

However, we cannot fully guarantee the security of data transmitted over the internet or stored electronically, so please use the Extension responsibly and at your own risk.

## Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted to this document, and we encourage you to review it periodically. Your continued use of the Extension after changes have been made will constitute your acknowledgment of the changes.
